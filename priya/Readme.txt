Things to remember-

1. If you are trying to use browser then it always try to send GET request if you are not specifying other method like
	POST, DELETE, PUT.
2. Try to learn POSTMAN client and send to some request using that.

Things to Do:

 1. I created some sample api for sending the POST request, now you have to create the POST reqest which will POST JSON
 data.  
 2. Instead of thing it's tough, take help form internet example and commit in this repository.
 
 How take code commited by me-
 1. Right click on project.
 2.  Team -> then -> Pull 
 3. It will update your project with new change done by me.
